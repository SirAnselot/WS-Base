# WS-Base
Basic startingpoint for frontend-design-production based on Bootstrap 4 and incl. a VendorJS-Compiler, libsass, Autoprefixer and UglifyJS. Requires Node and Grunt command line tools `grunt-cli` to use the Gruntfile.

## Tooling setup
1. Download and install [npm](https://www.npmjs.com), which we use to manage our dependencies.
2. Install the Grunt command line tools, `grunt-cli`, with `npm install -g grunt-cli`.
3. Navigate to the root `/WS-Base` directory and run `npm install` to install local dependencies listed in `package.json`.
4. optional: Install [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/), install [Bundler](http://bundler.io/) with `gem install bundler`, and finally run `bundle install`. This will install all Ruby dependencies, such as Jekyll and plugins.
